# nufwk
A repository which provides bare minimum starter examples with exact dependencies just for a given js framework to work. Generally, in js its quite easy to get bogged down by the dependencies. Saying that, on the other hand, there are javascript ninjas who have packaged starter examples which are simple to get going.

This repo is just a try to put out the bare essentials to focus on the javascript framework under question, thus learning in depth, rather than including dependencies without knowing their essence.
